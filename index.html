        <p>A game-play website featuring the ancient viking strategy game Hnefatafl, complete with strategy guides, rankings, and replays. I wrote the whole thing from the ground up incluidng database design, API, distributed websocket game rooms, javascript game engine and forum system.</p>

        <p>Rhynock is a simple wrapper around the gorilla websocket library, which I created to make text based websocket applications easier to write. A <a href="https://github.com/stealthycoin/rhynock/blob/master/examples/auth_chat/auth_example.go">chat</a> example server shows how easy it is to create a fully working chat server with authentication. </p>

        <p>Evogo is a genetic algoritm framework which I created as an exercise to learn Go. Initially I created it as a toy framework to play with the Go language and solve some fun problems like replicating complex images using only primitive colored shapes and decryption. After consulting with metamind evogo had many features added to it and is now used for their core algorithm.</p>

        <p>Hoard is a Go library I wrote to provide intelligent caching of static files in Go templates. I wrote it for use in kingstafl.com, the javascript game engine and replay system is very complicated and split across tens of files. Hoard batches, compresses and serves static files in groups to decrease the number of calls that need to be made to the server. The batched files are cached until any of the files are modified.</p>

        <p>Javascript image cropping library. An example <a href="http://stealthycoin.github.io/Pygmy-Marmoset/">page</a> shows how it works.</p>

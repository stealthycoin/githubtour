        <p>A game-play website featuring the ancient viking strategy game Hnefatafl (and other variants such as Brandubh, Longships, and Tablut), complete with strategy guides, rankings, and replays. I wrote the whole thing from the ground up incluidng database design, API, distributed websocket game rooms, javascript game engine and forum system. The backend is written entirely in Go, and uses PostgreSQL as the database. The frontend uses a custom written game engine and knockout as the only JS framework.</p>

        <p>Rhynock is a simple wrapper around the <a href="http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/pkg/websocket">gorilla websocket</a> library, which I created to make text based websocket applications easier to write. A <a href="https://github.com/stealthycoin/rhynock/blob/master/examples/auth_chat/auth_example.go">chat</a> example server shows how easy it is to create a fully working chat server with authentication. </p>

        <p>Evogo is a genetic algoritm framework which I created as an exercise to learn Go. Initially I created it as a toy framework to play with the Go language and solve some fun problems like replicating complex images using only primitive colored shapes and decryption. After consulting with metamind evogo had many features added to it and is now used to implement their core algorithm.</p>

          <a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="https://github.com/stealthycoin/hoard" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span>Hoard</a></h3>

        <p>Hoard is a Go library I wrote to provide intelligent caching of static files in Go templates. I wrote it for use in kingstafl.com, the javascript game engine and replay system is very complicated and split across tens of files. Hoard batches, compresses and serves static files in groups to decrease the number of calls that need to be made to the server. The batched files are cached until any of the files are modified. With the addition of Hoard, <a href="http://kingstafl.com">kingstafl.com</a> load times dropped from around 8-12 seconds to <2 seconds.</p>

        <p>A simple Javascript image cropping library, nothing I found did quite what I wanted so I wrote one that does. An example <a href="http://stealthycoin.github.io/Pygmy-Marmoset/">page</a> shows how it works.</p>

        <p>Toilet Mapper was my senior project that I completed with 5 other students. Toilet Mapper was a web service that takes your current location and allows you to search for nearby restrooms filtering by features such as male/female/cleanliness and so on. You can also add and rate bathrooms based on your current location. I was primarily responsible for the API and filtering the restrooms based on location and tags.</p>
